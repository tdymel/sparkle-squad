The 2025/26 season introduces several significant rule changes in volleyball, requiring both tactical and strategic adjustments from teams. Here is a summary of the key innovations:

1. Flexibility in Lineup and Visual Block Prevention: The serving team now has the freedom to position themselves however they like during the serve, as long as all players (except the server) are on the court. This rule change not only allows for quicker transitions into defensive formations but also aims to prevent the visual block. Players may not raise their hands above their heads until the ball has crossed the net, to avoid obstructing the receiving team's view. This promotes fairer play and necessitates new tactics in serve preparation.
2. Regulation for Ball Crossing into the Free Zone: A ball that crosses into the opponent's free zone after the second or third touch is considered "OUT." This limits the ability to return balls via the outer areas, requiring more precise attacks and setups.
3. Innovations in Simultaneous Ball Contacts: When two opponents simultaneously touch the ball above the net, play continues, even if the contact occurs over the opponent's field. This rule ensures a smoother and more dynamic game.
4. Permission to Reach Over the Net: After an attack hit, players may reach over the net as long as the ball contact occurred within their own playing area. This could lead to more aggressive attacks without violating fair play rules.
