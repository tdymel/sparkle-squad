## Introduction
In the hobby/mixed leagues, attacks are generally deeper in the field rather than very steep in the 3-meter zone.  
For this reason, we also draw the defense a little deeper into the field.  
The major weakness of this system is that the middle is always very open.  
Therefore, special attention must be paid to tip balls.

## Legend
First, the legend. It distinguishes between the players at the front (4, 3, 2) 
and the players in the backfield (5, 6, 1). 
The purple player is the opposing attacker. 
The area for which they are roughly responsible is also 
shaded in the same colors as the players.

## Attack from the Outside
When attacking from the outside, we leave the line open.  
In our league, few hit down the line.  
Most tipp the ball or hit diagonally.  
Therefore, we close off the diagonal and position someone on the line to receive.  
We cover the rest of the diagonal with the remaining players. Compared to the traditional system, 
the front outside attacker moves significantly further into the backfield here. We assume that balls are rarely 
hit so sharply into the diagonal.  
The person in position 6, usually the back outside, is responsible for the balls hit through the block or tosses. 
Positions 4 (outside), 5 (middle/libero), and 1 (opposite/setter) are responsible for the set balls into the middle.

### Short Setter/Opposite
If the setter or opposite at the front is short and an attempt to block would not be sensible or could even 
lead to injuries, it would be better to pull this player out a bit to cover tip balls.

## Attack from Diagonal
In this situation, the defense looks inverse to the situation when the attack comes from the outside.

## Middle attack
The middle is a bit tricky. Sometimes the attacks are so fast that you can only get one block up.  
We should, however, ensure that we always get two blocks up.

### Only the Middle blocks
This situation occurs when the attack is too fast or when both the outside and opposite/setter are too small to block. 
In this case, the middle blocker prefers one side, and the outside on position 6 must align accordingly.
