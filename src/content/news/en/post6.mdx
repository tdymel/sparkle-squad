On May 24, 2025, we participated in the 1st Mixed/Hobby Volleyball Lütjensee Tournament.
The tournament was held in a large 3-court hall with a really stylish wooden roof.
The ceilings were very high, which was really pleasant.

Twelve teams from the entire region were invited.
We met many new teams and also reconnected with many old ones.
In our group, we were able to prevail against every team and became group winners.
After that, we played against the second place team from the other group.
That was quite a tough match.
In the end, we narrowly won in the 3rd deciding set.
The final was similar.
The other team had very strong players.
Their middle blocker, in particular, left a lasting impression, smashing the balls into our field with incredible speed.
Unfortunately, we lost the 3rd deciding set 13 to 11.

Nonetheless, we are very satisfied with our performance.
We were able to prevail against very strong teams and always kept our composure.
The team sticks together, and it's a lot of fun hanging out with everyone.
After the tournament, some of us met at Mariia's place to have a barbecue together.

Next weekend, we might participate in the 1st Wakenitz Cup.
However, our participation is not yet confirmed, as this cup is actually for teams from Landesliga to Bundesliga level.
With that, the indoor tournament season is over, and the beach season begins.
Hopefully, the winter will bring many exciting tournaments again.
