On the 28th, we participated in the 13th MTV Pattensen Tournament.
The team included Perry, Vlad, Nadine, Mariia, Thorsten, Eugen, and Tom.
In the first round, we were in a strong group, including the eventual first 
and second place finishers of the tournament.
Unfortunately, we missed out on the top positions because we gave 
away a set against each of the first teams we played.
Ironically, we won 2 sets against the eventual winners. 
We almost managed to beat the second-place team as well.
What went wrong? It wasn't until the end that we found a 
composition that worked best.
In the second round, we played against the other third-place 
teams from the other groups. With these teams, we mixed up the 
positions again, as they weren't as strong as the teams from 
the first round.

Overall, we performed well in our debut!
We look forward to many more tournaments.
