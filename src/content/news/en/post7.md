On June 1, 2025, we participated in the 1st Mixed Volleyball Wakenitz Cup in Lübeck.
A total of 7 teams participated.
Most of them consisted of players with experience at the Landesliga level and above.
The tournament format was "round-robin," with a total of 2 sets up to 15.

We entered the tournament with no expectations.
The minimum requirement for the tournament was Landesliga level, and that's just where we are.
So our success at the tournament was all the more surprising for us.
Not only did we achieve 4th place, but we didn't lose heavily to any team.
All the matches were close.
With a bit of luck, the outcome could have been completely different.

This confirms for us that we can definitely compete in the A3 Mixed Hobby League next season.
In 3 weeks, the 3rd round of the Hansa Cup is coming up.
There it will be decided whether we advance to the final to compete for the Hansa Cup.
We have definitely got a taste for it and want to win the cup.
