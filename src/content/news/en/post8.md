Today we participated in the semifinal round of the Hamburg Hansa Cup.
The day started well, with glorious weather and everyone in good spirits.
As the day went on, it got warmer and warmer until the hall felt like a sauna.
Playing volleyball indoors at 34Â°C is quite exhausting.

We managed to win the first two games.
Then it was time for the final match against the team we had played and beaten first.
Unfortunately, everything went wrong for us, and we couldn't prevail.

If this round were decided by points, we would have still become the group leader, as we were tied with SCP Volleypop but had a better point difference. However, according to the rules of the Hansa Cup, only the winner of the last match advances.

Now we are unfortunately out of the Hansa Cup.
But this is not the end of tournaments.
On 19.07. and 20.07. we will participate in the 3rd Hamburg Mixed Tournament.
