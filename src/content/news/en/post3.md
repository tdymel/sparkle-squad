Shortly after our founding, we contacted various clubs and asked if there was still a training time slot available. Most clubs turned us down, but SVSTG said something could be arranged. Initially, no time was available, but with a bit of rearranging, a training time in the middle of Hamm could be arranged. 
Many thanks again to everyone involved!

Today was our first training session. 
Unfortunately, not all of us were present 
because no one expected we would get a time so quickly, 
but from next week on, the entire team will be ready to go!

Nevertheless, we still need more players to keep this slot in the long run.
