On April 27, 2025, we had our first match day as the official Sparkle Squad team at the Hansa-Pokal.  
We played against "Alibiblocker" and "Die Grünlinge."

First, we played against the "Alibiblocker". We won decisively.  
The team seemed to consist of many beginners. But they didn't give up – hats off!  
We used the game to get into the groove together, as we had never played in this configuration before.

The second game was much closer. We made many mistakes, but "Die Grünlinge" also persisted and defended many balls very well. In the end, all the sets were quite close!  
But a win is a win. Now on May 18, we are not occupied with a Hansa-Pokal match day and can therefore register for the Trave-Bull Tournament.

The match results can be found in the Wiki!
