Today was the 3rd matchday in the B1-4 Mixed Round League in Hamburg!
Last week, the 3rd A3 matchday was also supposed to take place, but unfortunately, it was canceled because Hamburg experienced a historic cold snap.

Brand new, we now have a uniform.
With it, we immediately make a much more impressive impression.

We won the first game confidently.
The second game started well, but from the second set, we somehow lost concentration and thus gave up the game.
