Starting a new team in Hamburg is not that easy. To get gym time, you need to bring a team, have some luck, and be very flexible. In the summer, we will first be able to play outside, but when it gets cold or rains, we would appreciate having a roof over our heads.

The good news is that we are allowed to participate in both the Mixed Round and the Hansa Cup without a gym and club.

Nevertheless, we now need to arrange some infrastructure. We need balls, a scoreboard, and probably a net.

Finally, it's about making ourselves discoverable. Whether through this website or via Instagram.

According to the motto "Slowly but surely," we are getting closer to our goal step by step!
