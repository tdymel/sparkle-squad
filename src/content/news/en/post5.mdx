On May 11, 2025, we participated in the [Mixed-Hobby Final Tournament in Stelle](https://volleyball-hoheheide.de/volley-mixed-abschlussturnier-der-region-hohe-heide-2025/).
This tournament had a slightly different format than usual.  
Only 8 teams were invited, which meant we often had only 10 minutes between each game.

At the beginning, we played against the hosts.  
We weren't quite warmed up yet and ended up hitting ball after ball against the wall, but not into the field.  
After that, however, we won almost every game.  
In the end, we unfortunately missed out on first place by just 2 points.

As a prize, we received some sweet treats and were even given a volleyball.  
That was truly unexpected.

Great praise to the NWVV and the hosts in Stelle for this wonderful tournament.  
Hopefully, we can participate again next year.  
Next up is the LÃ¼tjensee Tournament in 2 weeks!

Here, as a little bonus, is the video of the last game where we lost 2 points because everyone was tired.
