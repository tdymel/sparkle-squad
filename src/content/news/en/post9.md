Today, Senku invited us to their place for a friendly match.
The court was pretty hard to find, but we are happy that we found it in the end.

Everything didn't quite go smoothly that day.
Most of our team members canceled, and one person didn't show up because they forgot the date.
On top of that, two players were stuck in traffic, and the hall was available for only two hours.

This meant we quickly warmed up and hastily started playing.
We won the first game 25 to 21.
The second game we won 26 to 24, and the third game 25 to 16.
We lost the last game by a large margin.
Both teams tried out new things.

In the end, we had a lot of fun and look forward to the next friendly match against Senku.
We hope this will be a long-lasting friendship between our teams.
On August 10, we have been invited to play against the Willinghusener Sports Club, let's see how that goes.
